## Hints ##

Below are some hints that may help with this homework assignment:

  - When creating a default implementation, you can call other methods in the interface even if they are not implemented.
  
  - Most of the implementations in `WordIndex` require 1 to 3 lines of code.
  
  - The code will not compile until you implement the `Index` interface in the `WordIndex` class. 

You are not required to use these hints in your solution. There may be multiple approaches to solving this homework.
